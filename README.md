easysequencing
==============

A programm to detect matching sequences within two documents.

With the example application ElectionprogramComparer you can use the project-included election manifesto and coalition agreement 
or modify the pathes within the configuration section for an analysis of other documents.
You can choose between sequences with or without (german) stopwords 
and define the minimum length of the matching sequences that should be returned.

The program was used within a case study of a coalition between the german Greens and the SPD in Hessen, and is referenced in the doctoral thesis of Niko Switek "Bündnis 90/Die Grünen. Koalitionsentscheidungen in den Ländern.",
