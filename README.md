easysequencing
==============

A programm to detect matching sequences within two documents.

With the example application ElectionprogramComparer you can use the project-included election manifesto and coalition agreement 
or modify the pathes within the configuration section to your own documents.
You can choose between sequences with or without (german) stopwords 
and define the minimum length of the matching sequences that should be returned.
